This project operates a multithreaded file copy with progress
reporting.  Although multithreading will not improve IO on PC
hardware, on systems with multiple channels the ability to read and
write in parallel could result in significant improvement.

This program also outputs progress messages to stdout.  There are two
messages, [1,ByteCount] represents a progress message, and
[2,ByteCount] is a completion message.  The serialisation library is 
the binn library from https://github.com/liteserver/binn

I am considering putting in a delay thread also.  The idea is if this
program is taking up too much resource, and other activities are
suffering, to start another thread that grabs the read mutex and holds
it for a per defined time, allowing other processes with file IO a
bigger share of resource.
